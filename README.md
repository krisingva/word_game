### Inspired by a childhood word guessing game that shall remain anonymous

This is my first web application! It was built to practice the skills I learned in Launch School's RB175 Networked Applications course. Some fast facts about it:
- A Sinatra application
- Has very minimal CSS
- Not very pretty but it was fun to build!
- Comes with a test suite
- Built using Ruby 2.7.1
- See other dependencies in the `Gemfile.lock` file

To run the app locally:
Clone or pull the repo. Once you have it on your computer and are in the `word_game` directory, use the following command in the terminal:
```
bundle exec ruby word.rb
```
Then open up a browser and enter the following URL:
http://localhost:4567

To run the test suite:
```
bundle exec rake test
```
