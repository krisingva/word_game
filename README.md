### Inspired by a childhood word guessing game that shall remain anonymous

This is my first web application! It was built to practice the skills I learned in Launch School's RB175 Networked Applications course. Some fast facts about it:
- A Sinatra application
- Has very minimal CSS
- Not very pretty but it was fun to build!
- Comes with a test suite
- Built using Ruby 2.7.1

How to run it:
Clone or pull the repo. Once you have it on your computer, use the following command in the terminal:
`ruby $path_to_file/word.rb`
Then open up a browser and enter the following URL:
http://localhost:4567/
